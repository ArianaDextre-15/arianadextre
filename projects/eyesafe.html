                    <h2>Context & Problem</h2>
                    <p>Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects over 2.8 million people worldwide, often leading to upper limb motor impairments that limit independence in daily activities. Traditional rehabilitation can be repetitive and demotivating, resulting in poor adherence.</p>
                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>Chef Rehab addresses this challenge by transforming therapy into an engaging experience through virtual reality. This immersive game turns everyday cooking tasks into therapeutic exercises, promoting essential movements like pronation, abduction, and shoulder rotation. By combining gamification with rehabilitation principles, Chef Rehab enhances patient motivation, adherence, and functional recovery, offering a playful yet clinically meaningful solution.</p>
