                    <h2>Context & Problem</h2>
                    <p>La Oroya, Per√∫, is among the most polluted cities in the world. Prolonged exposure to heavy metals‚Äîespecially arsenic‚Äîaffects children‚Äôs neurological and physical development, increasing the risk of chronic diseases. Current detection methods like atomic absorption spectrometry are expensive, invasive, and require specialized labs, making them inaccessible for low-resource communities.</p>
                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>Oroya Safe is a portable, non-invasive device designed to detect arsenic levels in children affected by mining-related pollution. Using reflectance spectrophotometry, it analyzes skin optical properties to estimate arsenic concentration in real time. The device integrates with telemedicine platforms, enabling healthcare professionals to monitor results remotely and provide timely medical advice. Its portability, low cost, and solar-powered functionality make it ideal for remote areas with limited resources.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Increase patient engagement and motivation during rehabilitation sessions</li>
                        <li>Provide objective, quantifiable data on patient progress</li>
                        <li>Enable personalized rehabilitation protocols based on individual patient needs</li>
                        <li>Reduce the burden on healthcare professionals while improving outcomes</li>
                        <li>Make rehabilitation more accessible and cost-effective</li>
