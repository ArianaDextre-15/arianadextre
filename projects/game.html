                <p class="project-subtitle">Unity-based motor rehabilitation game with EMG integration</p>
                <p class="project-description">
                    I'm developing an innovative therapeutic video game in Unity focused on motor rehabilitation for patients with mobility impairments. The project combines game design principles with biomedical engineering to create an engaging rehabilitation experience that uses EMG sensors for real-time biofeedback.

                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>This therapeutic video game represents the intersection of my passion for technology and healthcare, creating solutions that can genuinely improve patients' quality of life through engaging, data-driven rehabilitation. The project is currently in active development, with me handling the programming aspects while collaborating with rehabilitation specialists and biomedical engineering faculty.</p>
                
                <p>The game is designed to make motor rehabilitation more engaging and effective by incorporating game mechanics that motivate patients to continue their therapy while providing valuable data on their progress. The integration of EMG sensors allows for real-time monitoring of muscle activity, enabling adaptive difficulty and personalized rehabilitation protocols.</p>
